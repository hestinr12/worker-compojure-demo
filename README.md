# worker-demo

This app deploys as a worker tier app which is hard linked to an input from an SQS queue. Every message that is sent to the SQS queue is POSTed  to the worker, who receives the object and sends a new message to a second queue. Currently, a message is routed to the second queue, however, extracting the body of the original queue has proven to be a pain. I realize that the message is being POSTed as 'application/json', yet attempts to add middleware to parse the body of the request have not proven to be successful. More to come...
